this is the final copy of the project. We weren't able to get everything in git working properly. I know normally with github you just pull from main and are able to run the code on your device. However, in order to run our project on your local host, you must start a react project with the App.tsx and theme.ts files in the src and then have a folder called cpp containing the .cpp, .h, and .py files, then have the server.js files in the root folder of the project. You also need to have all the dependencies installed and ensure you can run cors.
